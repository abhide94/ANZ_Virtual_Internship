# ANZ_Virtual_Internship

## Project Overview:

This task is based on a synthesised transaction dataset containing 3 months’ worth of transactions for 100 hypothetical customers. It contains: 

* Purchases 
* Recurring Transactions 
* Salary Transactions.

The dataset is designed to simulate realistic transaction behaviours that are observed in ANZ’s real transaction data, so many of the insights you can gather from the tasks below will be genuine.

## Resources
Python Version: 3.7

Packages: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sci-Kit Learn

Project Basis: Virtual Internship with ANZ


## Data Preparation and Customer Analytics

This consisted of the following stages:

* Examined transaction data looking for inconsistencies, missing data and outliers

* Cleaned the data using ordinal mapping and filling of missing values and outliers with statistical best fit values

* Visualize the relationship between Categorical and Continous variables.

### Counting of transction of each month according to date with respect movement. & status of card.

### Looking at the Transaction Data for across various months:

* Top customers in August:

## Model Prediction

* Machine Learning Algorithms used to predict the Salary of the customers:
      * Linear Regression
      * Decision Tree

* Exploring correlations between annual salary and various customer attributes as below:
      * Age
      * Gender
      * Balance 
      * Amount
      * Salary
